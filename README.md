Intro to Data Science - Course Project. This project focuses on predicting if a shot was made in an NBA match. The models are trained on a processed NBA Shot Logs dataset.

Dataset: NBA shot logs, season 14-15

Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Tabular Transformer, kNN Classifier, SGD Classifier, FC Neural Networks, XGBoost, Voting Classifier, AdaBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes

Training scripts are in ```src``` directory (train_model_dataset_task.py).

Model performance analysis is in ```notebooks``` directory (model_performance_analysis.ipynb).

Run ```python script.py -h``` for help.
